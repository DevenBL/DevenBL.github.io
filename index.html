            <h2>The Bluetooth Worm</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-20"></time>
            <article>
   </h3>The Risk of Bluetooth enabled devices.</h3>
    <p>An assortment of new devices are equipped with Bluetooth and more specifically Bluetooth low energy, a new implementation of Bluetooth to allow longer range low power mesh communication (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_URL> this poses an unprecedentedly massive security risk because Bluetooth has routinely proven to be vulnerable to many exploits (<a href="https://google.github.io/security-research/pocs/linux/bleedingtooth/writeup.html">https://google.github.io/security-research/pocs/linux/bleedingtooth/writeup.html</a>) and not to mention that many Bluetooth enabled products never receive software updates to solve these well documented vulnerabilities. This could allow an attacker to create a Bluetooth worm, that could compromise most devices in a city by crawling from Bluetooth enabled device to Bluetooth enabled device eventually infiltrating into corporate networks through: smart watches, wearables, Bluetooth speakers or any other Bluetooth enabled device. This could allow an attacker permanent access to internal networks as we do not have the ability to re-flash, reformat or control the vast majority of these Bluetooth devices.</p>

    <p>Additionally Faraday cages in combination with strict checking of Bluetooth enabled devices entering sensitive areas is rendered ineffective due to human error and does not protect from off band non-Bluetooth attack vectors</p>

    <h3>Mitigation</h3>
    <p>Mitigation of this threat requires a holistic approach such as Bluetooth and preferably WiFi jamming inside of Faraday cage rooms, along with strict access control on USB and other connection methods to prevent infected devices in secured zones from being connected to secured computers and other devices. This should handle the information technology side of this threat with reasonable effectiveness. However, this still allows for attack vectors such as smartphones that are no longer being provided software updates by the manufacturer to gain access to sensitive data through cameras, microphones and other information acquired through all of their sensors (<a href="https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p90-aliA.pdf">https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2015/papers/p90-aliA.pdf</a>).</p>

    <h3>Detection</h3>
    <p>Wireless detection is in this current environment completely infeasible as we do not have access or control over most Bluetooth devices and malicious communication between devices can be trivially hidden from view. A moderately competent attacker would also be able to prevent devices from showing obvious signs of infection such as a device exhibiting strange or unexpected behavior. The only feasible measure for detection would be a very long range Bluetooth snooping device monitoring Bluetooth traffic and doing some very advanced pattern recognition to detect possibly compromised devices; but this strategy does not mix well with most mitigation strategies and is currently prohibitively expensive.</p>

    <h3>Prevention</h3>
    <p>As I have mentioned throughout this document, the primary issue with these Bluetooth enabled devices is that they allow permanent access into our networks through our lack of access and control over these devices as we aren't able to remediate their security issues. The solution to this issue is long-term, competent, truly lifetime support and software updates for these devices. Unfortunately, manufacturers are unwilling to provide the long-term, often ten-to-forty year support required; due to the astronomical ongoing costs that this would entail. As such, the fundamental solution to this problem is open source firmware for these devices so that we have the ability to monitor and fix these glaring vulnerabilities ourselves.</p>

    <h3>Likelihood</h3>
    <p>Thankfully there have been no practical examples yet that we are aware of this large scale exploiting of Bluetooth that we are aware of. However, all the components of this attack have been individually developed and they have simply not been put together yet. Additionally, due to the difficulty of detecting this attack, it could have already happened and we have simply not noticed yet.</p>
